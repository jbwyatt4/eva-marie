Documentation
Remember if takes 20 secodns for you to comment a function.
It takes someone else a few minutes to understand. Comment your functions please.
If it takes more then a few seconds to understand a line of code-> Document it please.
A quick // to the side.
If you have problems reading your own code-the rest of the team will have even more.

Comment your uploads. We can view them in the public repository. It takes you
ten seconds to properly describe a change while it takes everyone else minutes
to determine a change.

Before every function: document what it does in like
/*****************
function foo
Arguments: int (height) , int (width) , struct ( n * n map )

foo prints a map starting with coordinates specified by height and width
see datastruct map for more details

or at least
/**
