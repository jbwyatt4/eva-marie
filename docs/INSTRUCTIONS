HINTS:

-LEVEL UP! If enemies seem too tough, just run and keep fighting weaker enemies!
-OPEN TREASURE CHESTS! You'll need the items in them!
-VISIT THE GENIE SHOP WHENEVER ITS AVAILABLE! The genie sells some items you'll need! Be careful though, since you must wait for the genie to restock
before you can visit him again!
